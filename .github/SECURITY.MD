## Security Considerations

### System Security Features

The Multiagent Hive System includes several security measures:

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Optional JWT-based authentication for API access
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for different operations
- **HTTPS Support**: TLS encryption for production deployments
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource handling
- **Secure Headers**: Security headers to prevent common attacks

### Secure Configuration

#### Environment Variables
```env
# Security settings
JWT_SECRET=your-256-bit-secret-key-here
API_KEY_REQUIRED=true
CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=100

# Database security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
DB_SSL_MODE=require

# Logging security
LOG_LEVEL=warn  # Avoid logging sensitive data
```

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production
- Configure firewalls to restrict access
- Use VPN for administrative access
- Implement network segmentation

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper session management
- Regular security audits and updates

### Best Practices for Users

#### Deployment Security
- Keep the system updated with latest security patches
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable authentication and authorization
- Configure rate limiting
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Regular backup of system data
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity

#### API Security
- Use API keys for programmatic access
- Implement proper authentication
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS for all API calls
- Implement rate limiting
- Log API access for auditing

#### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive configuration data
- Use secure database connections
- Implement data validation
- Regular security audits
- Secure backup procedures

### Security Testing

#### Automated Security Testing
```bash
# Run security scans
cargo audit  # Rust dependency vulnerabilities
npm audit    # Node.js dependency vulnerabilities

# Container security
trivy image your-registry/multiagent-hive:latest

# Static analysis
cargo clippy -- -W clippy::pedantic
```

#### Manual Security Testing
- Test authentication mechanisms
- Attempt SQL injection attacks
- Test XSS vulnerabilities
- Check for insecure direct object references
- Verify proper error handling
- Test rate limiting effectiveness

### Incident Response

#### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Detection**: Monitor for security events
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate the impact and scope
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems from clean backups
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve procedures

#### Contact Information
- **Security Team**: security@multiagent-hive.dev
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **PGP Key**: Available for encrypted communications

### Compliance

The system is designed to support compliance with:
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection (if applicable)
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data (if applicable)
- **SOX**: Financial reporting (if applicable)

### Security Updates

- Security patches are released as soon as possible
- Critical security updates may require immediate action
- Security advisories are published on GitHub
- Subscribe to security notifications

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask security researchers to:
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data
- Not perform DoS attacks or degrade service
- Not spam our systems with automated tools

### Recognition

Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:
- Acknowledged in security advisories (if they wish)
- Added to our security hall of fame
- Considered for bounties (when available)

Thank you for helping keep the Multiagent Hive System secure!
