# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction to AI Orchestrator Hub

The AI Orchestrator Hub is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed for intelligent task distribution, swarm coordination, and adaptive learning. Built with Rust for high performance and reliability, it combines traditional distributed systems patterns with cutting-edge AI techniques.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Multi-Agent System Design
The system is built around the concept of specialized agents working together:

- **Learner Agents**: Continuously improve through experience

### 2. Swarm Intelligence
Inspired by natural swarm behaviors:
- **Dynamic Coordination**: Agents adapt to changing conditions
- **Emergent Behavior**: Complex patterns emerge from simple rules
- **Self-Organization**: System reorganizes automatically based on workload
- **Resilience**: Continues operating even with agent failures

### 3. Neural Processing Integration
Hybrid neural capabilities:
- **CPU-Native Processing**: Default mode for broad compatibility
- **GPU Acceleration**: Optional for high-performance neural tasks
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuous improvement through experience
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced data analysis capabilities
