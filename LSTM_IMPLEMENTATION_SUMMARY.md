    pub sequence_length: usize,  // Memory window size
}
```

#### **Temporal Processing**
- **Sequence Context**: Maintains sliding window of performance history
- **Trend Analysis**: Linear regression for performance trajectory
- **Momentum Calculation**: Recent vs. historical performance comparison
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learning rate adjusts based on recent success

#### **Advanced Capabilities**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies temporal patterns in agent performance
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasts future performance based on sequence history
- **Context-Aware Processing**: Enhances text processing with temporal information
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusts behavior based on performance trends

### **Integration with Hybrid Architecture:**

#### **Agent Creation**
```rust
// LSTM agents automatically created for forecasting specialization
processor.create_neural_agent(
    agent_id,
    "forecasting".to_string(),  // Triggers LSTM mode
    true,                       // Enable advanced neural features
).await?;
```

#### **Automatic Selection**
- **Basic NLP**: Default for general tasks
- **FANN Networks**: Pattern recognition and classification
- **LSTM Networks**: Forecasting and temporal analysis

#### **Seamless Operation**
- All agents work together in the same hive
- Automatic method selection based on agent type
- Consistent API across all neural processing modes

### **Performance Benefits:**

#### **Temporal Intelligence**
- Learns from sequence patterns, not just individual tasks
- Adapts predictions based on performance trends
- Maintains context across multiple interactions

#### **Improved Accuracy**
- Combines historical performance with current task analysis
- Adjusts for task complexity and agent capability trends
- Provides confidence-based predictions

#### **CPU-Native Design**
- No external dependencies for basic LSTM functionality
- Efficient sequence processing with configurable memory
- Scales from simple trend analysis to complex pattern recognition

### **Example Usage:**
```rust
// Create LSTM agent
let lstm_agent = processor.create_neural_agent(
    agent_id, "forecasting".to_string(), true
).await?;

// Train with sequence
processor.learn_from_interaction_adaptive(
    agent_id, "predict sales", "forecast complete", true
).await?;

// Get sequence-aware prediction
let prediction = processor.predict_performance(
    agent_id, "forecast quarterly revenue"
).await?;
```

### **Testing:**
