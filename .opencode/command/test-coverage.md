# Test Coverage Command

Perform comprehensive test coverage analysis across the entire AI Orchestrator Hub project, including Rust backend, React frontend, integration tests, and end-to-end tests with detailed reporting and improvement recommendations.

## Comprehensive Coverage Strategy

### 1. Environment Setup
Prepare coverage analysis environment:

```bash
# Ensure test environment is ready
npm run test:env:setup

# Create coverage reports directory
mkdir -p coverage-reports/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Set coverage configuration
export COVERAGE_FORMAT=lcov,html,json
export COVERAGE_THRESHOLD=80
export COVERAGE_FAIL_ON_DECREASE=true
